Core Investment Thesis (Teaser-Level):
Exceptional frontage-to-land ratio: approximately 3 miles (5 km) beachfront, positioned as a key differentiator versus typical resort sites.
True masterplan flexibility: the site’s scale and geometry support phased delivery (develop a portion, land-bank the remainder) and multiple revenue layers (keys, villas, branded residences, experiences).
Unique natural amenities: lagoon frontage, coral reef formations, and a large natural pool environment suitable for safe water activities.
Tourism-driven policy tailwinds: the Tourism Incentive Act 158-01 (CONFOTUR) is referenced as offering tax exemptions up to 15 years for qualifying tourism investments.
Access + infrastructure pathway: ~90-minute access to two international airports and referenced proximity to utilities/infrastructure expansion corridors.
“Hurricane-safer” positioning (as marketed): protected by a major mountain range and positioned as a recognized “hurricane hole” area within yachting narratives (to be verified in DD).

Value-Add / Upside Angle:
This is a classic institutional-scale land-to-hospitality transformation play: acquire a unique coastal canvas at scale, execute a branded masterplan, and unlock value through product segmentation (ultra-luxury villas + resort keys + experiences), infrastructure phasing, and operator strategy.',

The asset is currently undergoing a phased renovation program, with the lobby fully renovated and approximately 50% of guest rooms upgraded, targeting full completion in 2025. This transitional phase presents a clear value-add opportunity through completion of renovations, operational optimization, and potential repositioning.

In addition, the property includes approximately 706 sqm of unused development potential, as well as a ground-floor restaurant space, allowing for further revenue enhancement through F&B activation or expansion.
